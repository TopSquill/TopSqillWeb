# Context and Variables in Hugo

## Example repository

This repository holds an example project for an article on context and variables in the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io).

The repository has tags corresponding to the sections of the article:

- `1-start`
- `2-params`
- `3-flow-control`
- `4-global-context`
- `5-partials`

To run the project, make sure [Hugo is installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/), then run `hugo server` in the project root. You should now be able to see the site by visiting [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) in your browser.
